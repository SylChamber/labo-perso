{"id":"521da052-6f4c-4730-af4f-3cd7b4f79441","zed":"context","version":"0.4.0","text":"\n\n\ni installed CoreDNS in a k3s cluster on a Ubuntu 24.04 server named 'motel' as a separate instance from the CoreDNS instance that is part of the k3s cluster, in a separate namespace 'lan-dns'. I used the helm chart from the CoreDNS project.\n\nSince Ubuntu uses port 53 for systemd-resolved, I exposed the CoreDNS service on port 5353 as a LoadBalancer service.\n\nSince I would like to use this CoreDNS instance as the DNS server for my home network, I configured 'systemd-resolved' to use the 'lan-dns' CoreDNS instance as the DNS server by creating the following file in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/lan-dns.conf:\n\n[Resolve]\nDNS=192.168.50.247:5353 192.168.50.1 24.200.241.37 24.201.245.77 24.200.243.189\n\nThe first DNS server is the CoreDNS instance running on the 'motel' server, the second is the router's DNS server, and the rest are the ISP's DNS servers.\n\nName resolution works as expected in 'motel', but not outside of it. From machine 'arcade', if I run the following command:\n\ndig @192.168.50.247 google.com\n\ni get 'no servers could be reached', but the following command works:\n\ndig @192.168.50.247 -p 5353 google.com\n\nHow can i configure 'motel' so port 53 is accessible to machines on the local network?\n# Configuring CoreDNS on Port 53 in Ubuntu 24.04\n\nYou're experiencing a common issue when running DNS services on Ubuntu systems. Since `systemd-resolved` is using port 53, your CoreDNS instance can't bind to the same port. Here are the steps to make port 53 available for your CoreDNS instance:\n\n## Option 1: Disable systemd-resolved on port 53\n\n1. Modify the systemd-resolved configuration:\n   ```bash\n   sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf\n   ```\n\n2. Add or modify these lines:\n   ```\n   [Resolve]\n   DNSStubListener=no\n   ```\n\n3. Restart systemd-resolved:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved\n   ```\n\n4. Update your system's DNS configuration:\n   ```bash\n   sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf\n   sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf\n   ```\n\n5. Reconfigure your CoreDNS service to use port 53 instead of 5353\n\n## Option 2: Use iptables to redirect traffic\n\nIf you prefer keeping systemd-resolved running on port 53, you can use iptables to redirect external traffic on port 53 to port 5353:\n\n```bash\nsudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-port 5353\nsudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-port 5353\n```\n\nTo make these rules persistent:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install iptables-persistent\nsudo netfilter-persistent save\n```\n\n## Option 3: Use a reverse proxy like HAProxy\n\nYou could set up HAProxy to forward DNS requests from port 53 to port 5353.\n\n---\n\nI recommend Option 1 if you intend to use this server primarily as a DNS server for your network, as it's the cleanest approach. Option 2 is a good compromise if you want to keep systemd-resolved functioning normally on the server itself.\noption 2 does not seem to work, how do i remove the iptables rules?\n# Removing iptables Rules\n\nI'm sorry to hear that Option 2 didn't work for you. Here's how to remove those iptables rules:\n\n## Remove the iptables redirect rules\n\n1. First, list the current NAT rules to identify the rule numbers:\n\n```bash\nsudo iptables -t nat -L PREROUTING --line-numbers\n```\n\n2. Remove the rules by their line numbers (assuming they are lines 1 and 2, adjust as needed):\n\n```bash\nsudo iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING 1  # Removes the first rule\nsudo iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING 1  # Removes what was the second rule, now the first\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can remove them by directly specifying the rules:\n\n```bash\nsudo iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-port 5353\nsudo iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-port 5353\n```\n\n3. Verify that the rules are removed:\n\n```bash\nsudo iptables -t nat -L PREROUTING\n```\n\n4. If you made the rules persistent with iptables-persistent, update the saved rules:\n\n```bash\nsudo netfilter-persistent save\n```\n\n## Let's try Option 1 instead\n\nSince Option 2 didn't work, I'd recommend trying Option 1 (disabling systemd-resolved on port 53). It's generally more reliable and a cleaner approach for your use case of running CoreDNS as the primary DNS server for your network.\n\nIf you have any issues implementing Option 1, please let me know and I can provide more detailed guidance.\ni choose option 1. i added /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/lan-dns.conf with the following content:\n\n```\n[Resolve]\nDNSStubListener=no\n```\n\nI restarted the systemd-resolved service. The /etc/resolv.conf file is a symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf that is itself a symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf.\n\nhow do i check if the DNSStubListener is disabled, and if port 53 is being listened to?\n# Verifying DNSStubListener Status and Port 53 Availability\n\nLet's verify that your changes have taken effect properly:\n\n## 1. Check if DNSStubListener is disabled\n\nYou can verify the current systemd-resolved configuration with:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemd-resolve --status\n```\n\nLook for the \"DNSStubListener\" line - it should show \"no\" or \"disabled\".\n\nAlternatively, you can directly check the resolved configuration:\n\n```bash\nresolvectl status\n```\n\n## 2. Check if port 53 is available (not being used by systemd-resolved)\n\nUse one of these commands to check if anything is listening on port 53:\n\n```bash\nsudo ss -tuln | grep 53\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nsudo netstat -tuln | grep 53\n```\n\nIf systemd-resolved has properly released port 53, you should not see any service listening on 127.0.0.53:53 (the default for systemd-resolved's stub listener).\n\n## 3. Fix your resolv.conf setup\n\nYour current resolv.conf configuration might be incorrect. Since you've disabled the stub listener, the symlink should point to `/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf`, not through stub-resolv.conf.\n\nRun these commands to fix it:\n\n```bash\nsudo rm /etc/resolv.conf\nsudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf\n```\n\n## 4. Reconfigure CoreDNS to use port 53\n\nNow you can update your CoreDNS Helm deployment to use port 53 instead of 5353. This typically involves modifying your Helm values file or using the --set parameter.\n\n## 5. Test DNS resolution\n\nAfter reconfiguring CoreDNS to use port 53, verify it's working:\n\n```bash\ndig @192.168.50.247 google.com\n```\n\nThis should now work without specifying the port number, as it will use the default DNS port (53).\nthanks, DNS resolution is working as expected from other machines on the network. But the CoreDNS instance in the k3s cluster is not used locally on the 'motel' machine that hosts the k3s cluster and the CoreDNS instance. How can we ensure that the CoreDNS instance is used locally on the 'motel' machine?\n# Configuring Local DNS Resolution on the Motel Host Machine\n\nTo ensure that your CoreDNS instance running in K3s is used for local DNS resolution on the 'motel' host machine itself, we need to configure systemd-resolved to use the CoreDNS instance as its upstream DNS server.\n\n## Steps to Configure Local DNS Resolution\n\n1. **Update systemd-resolved configuration**\n\n   Since you've disabled the DNSStubListener, you'll need to explicitly tell systemd-resolved to use your CoreDNS instance. Edit your existing configuration file:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/lan-dns.conf\n   ```\n\n   Update it to use your CoreDNS service running on localhost:\n\n   ```\n   [Resolve]\n   DNSStubListener=no\n   DNS=127.0.0.1:53 192.168.50.1 24.200.241.37 24.201.245.77 24.200.243.189\n   Domains=~.\n   ```\n\n   This tells systemd-resolved to use your local CoreDNS instance first, then fall back to the other DNS servers.\n\n2. **Restart systemd-resolved**\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify DNS resolution is working through your CoreDNS**\n\n   ```bash\n   resolvectl query google.com\n   ```\n\n   Check which server was used in the response.\n\n## Alternative Approach: Direct /etc/resolv.conf Configuration\n\nIf you prefer a more traditional approach, you can bypass systemd-resolved entirely:\n\n1. **Disable systemd-resolved service**:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl disable --now systemd-resolved\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a static /etc/resolv.conf**:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf\n   sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf\n   ```\n\n   Add:\n   ```\n   nameserver 127.0.0.1\n   nameserver 192.168.50.1\n   options edns0\n   search lan\n   ```\n\n3. **Make resolv.conf immutable** (to prevent other services from changing it):\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf\n   ```\n\n## Testing\n\nTo test that your local machine is using the CoreDNS instance for DNS resolution:\n\n```bash\ndig google.com +short\n```\n\nIf you want to verify which server is handling the request, you can temporarily add logging to your CoreDNS configuration and watch the logs for local queries.\n\nYou can also modify your CoreDNS configuration to return different results for a test domain and confirm it works locally:\n\n```bash\ndig test.local\n```\n\nLet me know if you need help with any of these steps!\nthanks, i updated the systemd-resolved configuration, and name resolution for the local network works on 'motel'. But name resolution does not work on 'motel' for external domains. How can I troubleshoot this issue?\n# Troubleshooting External DNS Resolution on 'motel'\n\nLet's systematically troubleshoot why external domain resolution isn't working on your 'motel' host while local domain resolution works fine.\n\n## 1. Verify CoreDNS Forwarding Configuration\n\nFirst, let's check if your CoreDNS is properly configured to forward external domain requests to upstream DNS servers:\n\n```bash\n# View your CoreDNS ConfigMap\nkubectl get configmap -n lan-dns coredns -o yaml\n```\n\nYour CoreDNS Corefile should have a forward directive for domains that aren't handled locally. It should look something like:\n\n```\n. {\n    forward . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n    cache 30\n}\n```\n\nIf this is missing, you'll need to update your CoreDNS configuration to properly forward external domains.\n\n## 2. Test DNS Resolution at Different Levels\n\nLet's test DNS resolution at different points in the stack:\n\n```bash\n# Test direct against CoreDNS\ndig @127.0.0.1 -p 53 google.com\n\n# Test using systemd-resolved directly\nresolvectl query google.com\n\n# Test using standard resolver\ndig google.com\n```\n\n## 3. Check systemd-resolved Status and Logs\n\n```bash\n# Check systemd-resolved status\nsystemd-resolve --status\n\n# Check logs for DNS resolution issues\njournalctl -u systemd-resolved -f\n```\n\n## 4. Check CoreDNS Logs\n\n```bash\n# View CoreDNS logs\nkubectl logs -n lan-dns -l app=coredns\n```\n\nLook for any errors related to forwarding or external domain resolution.\n\n## 5. Test Network Connectivity to External DNS\n\nMake sure your CoreDNS pod can reach external DNS servers:\n\n```bash\n# Get a shell in the CoreDNS pod\nkubectl exec -it -n lan-dns $(kubectl get pods -n lan-dns -l app=coredns -o name | head -1) -- /bin/sh\n\n# Test network connectivity to Google's DNS\nping 8.8.8.8\n```\n\n## 6. Verify resolv.conf\n\nCheck the actual content of your system's resolv.conf:\n\n```bash\ncat /etc/resolv.conf\n```\n\n## 7. Temporary Workaround for Testing\n\nIf you want to quickly test if the issue is with your CoreDNS configuration, temporarily modify your `/etc/resolv.conf` to use a public DNS for testing:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/resolv.conf\n```\n\nAdd a line at the top:\n```\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n```\n\nTest resolution and then revert the change.\n\n## 8. Check for Firewall Issues\n\n```bash\nsudo iptables -L -n\n```\n\nMake sure there are no firewall rules blocking outbound DNS traffic from your CoreDNS pods.\n\nBased on the results of these diagnostic steps, we can further narrow down the issue and provide a specific solution. Let me know what you discover!\nthe coredns pod does not have a shell. The resolv.conf file contains the following:\n\nnameserver 192.168.50.247\nnameserver 192.168.50.1\nnameserver 24.200.241.37\n# Too many DNS servers configured, the following entries may be ignored.\nnameserver 24.201.245.77\nnameserver 192.168.50.1\nnameserver 192.168.50.1\nsearch .\n\nthat comment on too many servers, is that an issue?\n# Resolving DNS Configuration Issues\n\nThe \"Too many DNS servers configured\" comment in your `/etc/resolv.conf` is indeed part of the problem. Linux systems typically have a limit (often 3) on the number of nameservers they'll use from resolv.conf, and additional servers are ignored.\n\nAlso, I notice your CoreDNS instance (192.168.50.247) is listed first, which means your system is trying to use it for all DNS resolution, but CoreDNS itself may not be properly configured to handle external domains.\n\n## Fix the resolv.conf Configuration\n\n1. **Simplify the resolv.conf file**:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/lan-dns.conf\n```\n\nChange it to:\n```\n[Resolve]\nDNSStubListener=no\nDNS=127.0.0.1 1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8\n```\n\n2. **Restart systemd-resolved**:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved\n```\n\n3. **Verify the updated resolv.conf**:\n```bash\ncat /etc/resolv.conf\n```\n\n## Check CoreDNS Configuration\n\nSince your CoreDNS pod doesn't have a shell, let's examine and update its configuration:\n\n1. **View current CoreDNS configuration**:\n```bash\nkubectl get cm -n lan-dns coredns -o yaml\n```\n\n2. **Update the ConfigMap** if it doesn't have proper forwarding:\n```bash\nkubectl edit cm -n lan-dns coredns\n```\n\nEnsure it has a section like this:\n```yaml\n.:53 {\n    forward . 8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1\n    cache 30\n    errors\n    health\n    ready\n}\n```\n\n3. **Restart CoreDNS** after configuration changes:\n```bash\nkubectl rollout restart deployment -n lan-dns coredns\n```\n\n## Test External Resolution\n\nAfter making these changes:\n```bash\ndig google.com\n```\n\n## Debugging Without Shell\n\nIf you can't access a shell in the CoreDNS pod, you can:\n\n1. **Check pod logs**:\n```bash\nkubectl logs -n lan-dns $(kubectl get pods -n lan-dns -l app=coredns -o name | head -1)\n```\n\n2. **Run a temporary debugging pod**:\n```bash\nkubectl run -it --rm debug --image=busybox:1.28 -- sh\n```\n\nFrom this pod:\n```\nping 8.8.8.8\nnslookup google.com\n```\n\nThe key problem appears to be a combination of:\n1. Too many DNS servers in your configuration\n2. Your CoreDNS instance likely not being configured to forward external domains\n3. A recursive loop where your system is trying to use CoreDNS for resolution, but CoreDNS may be trying to use the system's DNS\n\nThe changes above should break this loop and fix the external domain resolution.\n\nthe debug pod above uses the cluster's DNS service so it can resolve external domains correctly.\n\nhowever, local resolution in 'motel' of external domains is still not working.\n# Advanced Troubleshooting for External DNS Resolution on 'motel'\n\nLet's take a more in-depth approach to diagnose why external DNS resolution isn't working on the 'motel' host while it works fine from within the cluster.\n\n## 1. Check DNS Query Path and DNS Loop\n\nOne common issue is a DNS resolution loop. Let's check if your CoreDNS instance is trying to use itself for resolution:\n\n```bash\n# Check what DNS servers CoreDNS is configured to use\nkubectl get cm -n lan-dns coredns -o yaml\n```\n\nLook for the `forward` directive and make sure it's not pointing back to the local system or creating a loop.\n\n## 2. Detailed DNS Query Testing\n\nLet's perform detailed DNS queries with debugging enabled:\n\n```bash\n# Check direct CoreDNS resolution with debugging\ndig +trace @127.0.0.1 google.com\n\n# Test systemd-resolved explicitly \nresolvectl query --cache=no google.com\n\n# Check DNS resolution with verbose output\ndig +trace google.com\n```\n\n## 3. Examine Network Traffic\n\nLet's use tcpdump to capture DNS traffic and see what's happening:\n\n```bash\n# Install tcpdump if needed\nsudo apt-get install tcpdump\n\n# Capture DNS traffic\nsudo tcpdump -i any port 53 -n\n```\n\nIn another terminal, run `dig google.com` and observe the packet flow in tcpdump.\n\n## 4. Test CoreDNS Directly with nslookup\n\n```bash\n# Test with nslookup which uses different resolver code\nnslookup google.com 127.0.0.1\n```\n\n## 5. Check Local Network Configuration\n\n```bash\n# Check gateway and routing\nip route\n\n# Verify DNS server can be reached\nping 8.8.8.8\n```\n\n## 6. Bypass systemd-resolved Temporarily\n\nLet's test by temporarily bypassing systemd-resolved:\n\n```bash\n# Create a test resolv.conf file\necho \"nameserver 8.8.8.8\" > /tmp/resolv.conf\n\n# Test resolution using this file\ndig @8.8.8.8 google.com\n```\n\n## 7. Force CoreDNS to Use Specific Upstream DNS\n\nEdit your CoreDNS ConfigMap:\n\n```bash\nkubectl edit cm -n lan-dns coredns\n```\n\nEnsure it has an explicit forward directive:\n```\n.:53 {\n    forward . 8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1 {\n        force_tcp\n    }\n    cache 30\n    errors\n    log\n    health\n    ready\n}\n```\n\nThe `force_tcp` option might help bypass potential UDP filtering issues.\n\n## 8. Check Container Network Interfaces\n\n```bash\n# Check if CNI is affecting DNS traffic\nsudo ls -la /etc/cni/net.d/\n```\n\n## 9. Try Alternate Approach: Run a Local CoreDNS Outside K8s\n\nAs a diagnostic step, you could try running CoreDNS directly on the host (outside of Kubernetes):\n\n```bash\n# Install CoreDNS directly\nwget https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/download/v1.10.1/coredns_1.10.1_linux_amd64.tgz\ntar xzf coredns_1.10.1_linux_amd64.tgz\n\n# Create a simple Corefile\ncat > Corefile <<EOF\n.:53 {\n    forward . 8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1\n    cache 30\n    log\n    errors\n}\nEOF\n\n# Run CoreDNS directly (as root to bind to port 53)\nsudo ./coredns\n```\n\nTest if this works while the K8s-based CoreDNS is stopped.\n\n## 10. Full System Logs Check\n\n```bash\n# Check system logs for DNS-related issues\nsudo journalctl -xe | grep -i dns\n```\n\nThese detailed diagnostics should help identify exactly where the DNS resolution chain is breaking down. Please share any interesting findings from these tests.\n\ni see no errors in the coredns pod logs. The forward instruction is correct and should work as expected. here is the configmap data for coredns:\nCorefile:\n----\nici:53 {\n    errors\n    health\n    ready\n    file /etc/coredns/ici.db ici\n    forward . 24.200.241.37 24.201.245.77\n    cache 30\n}\n\nici.db:\n----\n$ORIGIN ici.\n$TTL 3600\n@       IN      SOA     ns.ici. admin.ici.

Your CoreDNS configuration is only set up to handle the \"ici\" zone - it doesn't have any configuration for the root zone (\".\"), which is needed to handle all other domains like google.com.\n\n## The Problem\n\nYour current CoreDNS configuration only has a section for \"ici:53\" but nothing for handling the root zone (\".\"). This means CoreDNS refuses any queries for domains outside the \"ici\" zone.\n\n## Solution: Update CoreDNS ConfigMap\n\nYou need to add a configuration block for the root zone. Here's how to fix it:\n\n```bash\nkubectl edit cm -n lan-dns coredns -o yaml\n```\n\nAdd this section to your Corefile data:\n\n```\n.:53 {\n    errors\n    health\n    ready\n    forward . 24.200.241.37 24.201.245.77\n    cache 30\n}\n\nici:53 {\n    errors\n    health\n    ready\n    file /etc/coredns/ici.db ici\n    forward . 24.200.241.37 24.201.245.77\n    cache 30\n}\n```\n\nThe new section at the top will handle all domains that don't match the \"ici\" zone.\n\n## After Making Changes\n\nAfter editing the ConfigMap, restart the CoreDNS pods to apply the changes:\n\n```bash\nkubectl rollout restart deployment -n lan-dns coredns\n```\n\nWait for the pods to restart, then test external domain resolution again:\n\n```bash\ndig google.com\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\nYour CoreDNS was correctly configured for the \"ici\" domain, but when your system tried to resolve \"google.com\", CoreDNS had no instructions for handling non-\"ici\" domains, so it returned REFUSED.\n\nThe new root zone configuration tells CoreDNS to forward any non-\"ici\" domain requests to your specified upstream DNS servers, which should fix the external domain resolution issue.\n\nThis should resolve your problem while maintaining the local DNS resolution for your \"ici\" domain.\nthe helm chart from the coredns project does not allow me to specify more than one zone. But I configured only the root zone '.:53' then inserted the 'file' plugin for the 'ici' zone just before the 'forward' plugin, and it fixed the issue.\n# Great Solution for CoreDNS Configuration\n\nYou found an excellent solution to the problem! Configuring a single zone with multiple plugins is a clean approach when working with the CoreDNS Helm chart's limitations.\n\n## Your Effective Configuration\n\nYour approach correctly uses the zone hierarchy in CoreDNS. By configuring:\n\n```\n.:53 {\n    errors\n    health\n    ready\n    file /etc/coredns/ici.db ici  # Handles ici zone specifically\n    forward . 24.200.241.37 24.201.245.77  # Handles everything else\n    cache 30\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration:\n1. Uses the file plugin for the \"ici\" zone first\n2. Falls back to the forward plugin for all other domains\n3. Maintains all the necessary monitoring plugins (errors, health, ready)\n\n## Why This Works Well\n\nCoreDNS processes plugins in order for each incoming query. With your configuration:\n- For \"something.ici\" queries: The file plugin matches and serves from your DB file\n- For all other queries like \"google.com\": The file plugin doesn't match, so CoreDNS moves to the forward plugin\n\n## Benefits of Your Approach\n\n1. **Simplicity**: A single zone makes the configuration easier to maintain\n2. **Full functionality**: Handles both local and external domains correctly\n3. **Works with Helm limitations**: Adapts to the chart's constraints\n\n## Going Forward\n\nIf you need to add more local zones in the future, you could:\n1. Add more file plugin entries for different zone files\n2. Consider using the hosts plugin for simple name/address pairs\n3. Use the rewrite plugin for more complex DNS manipulations\n\nYour solution demonstrates a solid understanding of how CoreDNS processes queries and plugins. Well done on resolving the issue!\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5141}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":213},"start":1219,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5142}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":214},"start":2920,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5143}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":265},"start":2988,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5144}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":266},"start":4390,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5145}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":753},"start":4799,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5146}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":754},"start":6440,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5147}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1141},"start":6746,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5148}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1142},"start":9043,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5149}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1538},"start":9259,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5150}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1539},"start":11738,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5151}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1904},"start":12106,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5152}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1905},"start":14421,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5153}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":2522},"start":14598,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5154}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":2523},"start":17740,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5155}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3065},"start":17885,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5156}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3900},"start":19474,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5157}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3901},"start":21360,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5158}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":5078},"start":21601,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5159}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":5079},"start":23282,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5160}}}],"summary":"Troubleshooting CoreDNS Setup for both local and external DNS resolution","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
