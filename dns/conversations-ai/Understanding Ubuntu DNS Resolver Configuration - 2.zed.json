It's connected to the Internet with a wired connection via an Asus wifi router that is connected to a cable modem. The router assigns IPs in the 198.168.50.0/24 subnet.\n\nthe '/etc/resolv.conf' file contains '127.0.0.53' as the DNS server. Where does this IP address come from and where does it point to?\nThe IP address 127.0.0.53 in your /etc/resolv.conf file is a local DNS resolver provided by systemd-resolved, which is Ubuntu's default DNS resolution service. This is not actually your external DNS server, but rather a local DNS stub resolver that runs on your system.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. systemd-resolved runs as a local DNS service on your machine and listens on 127.0.0.53:53\n2. When your system makes a DNS query, it first goes to this local resolver\n3. systemd-resolved then:\n   - Checks its cache for previously resolved queries\n   - If not found, forwards the request to the actual DNS servers (typically obtained from your router via DHCP)\n   - In your case, these would likely be the DNS servers provided by your Asus router or your ISP\n\nYou can see the actual upstream DNS servers being used by running:\n```bash\nresolvectl status\n```\nor\n```bash\nsystemd-resolve --status\n```\n\nThis setup provides several benefits:\n- Local DNS caching\n- Support for multiple DNS configurations\n- Better handling of VPN and different network interfaces\n- DNSSEC validation\n- DNS-over-TLS support\n\nThe actual external DNS servers your system uses are typically obtained automatically via DHCP from your Asus router, which in turn might be using your ISP's DNS servers or custom DNS servers if you've configured them in your router settings.\ni'm trying to run a DNS server in a k3s kubernetes cluster on another machine in order to provide DNS resolution for my local network. This will allow me to use custom domain names for my services within the cluster and ensure that they are accessible from other devices on my local network. It's a separate CoreDNS deployment than the one provided by k3s because I don't want to interfere with the DNS resolution in the cluster. \n\nI tried deploying CoreDNS with the helm chart provided by the CoreDNS project. I exposed CoreDNS as a LoadBalancer service on port 53. I provided these values:\n\n```yaml\n# Déploiement CoreDNS comme DNS externe pour réseau local\n\nserviceType: \"LoadBalancer\"\n\n# service dns externe\nisClusterService: false\n\n# configuration CoreDNS\nservers:\n  - zones:\n      - zone: .\n    port: 53\n    plugins:\n      - name: errors\n      - name: health\n      - name: ready\n      - name: file\n        parameters: /etc/coredns/ici.db ici\n      - name: forward\n        parameters: . /etc/resolv.conf\n      - name: cache\n        parameters: 30\n\nzoneFiles:\n  - filename: ici.db\n    domain: ici\n    contents: |\n      arcade.ici.  IN    A        192.168.50.247\n      ai.ici.      IN    CNAME    arcade.ici.\n      ia.ici.      IN    CNAME    arcade.ici.\n      motel.ici.   IN    A        192.168.50.185\n      cloud.ici.   IN    CNAME    motel.ici.\n      nuage.ici.   IN    CNAME    motel.ici.\n\n```\n\nBut now, name resolution in the cluster is broken because of my deployment of CoreDNS. The requests stop at the cluster. The cluster is unable to resolve the DNS queries because my it forwards unresolved queries to my deployment of CoreDNS. To fix this issue, I need to configure my deployment to forward unresolved queries to the host's systemd-resolved service.\n\nHow can i do that?\nThe issue is occurring because your CoreDNS configuration is forwarding queries to `/etc/resolv.conf` which, in the container context, might be creating a DNS forwarding loop or not pointing to the correct upstream DNS.\n\nTo forward unresolved queries to the host's systemd-resolved (127.0.0.53), you need to modify the `forward` plugin configuration. However, since 127.0.0.53 is only available on the host, you should instead forward to your router's DNS (likely 192.168.50.1) or public DNS servers. Here's how you can modify your configuration:\n\n```yaml\nservers:\n  - zones:\n      - zone: .\n    port: 53\n    plugins:\n      - name: errors\n      - name: health\n      - name: ready\n      - name: file\n        parameters: /etc/coredns/ici.db ici\n      - name: forward\n        # Forward to your router's DNS server and Google DNS as backup\n        parameters: . 192.168.50.1 8.8.8.8\n      - name: cache\n        parameters: 30\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could use specific public DNS servers:\n\n```yaml\n      - name: forward\n        # Using Cloudflare and Google DNS\n        parameters: . 1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8\n```\n\nThis configuration will:\n1. Try to resolve local zone entries first (your .ici domain)\n2. Forward any unmatched queries to the specified upstream DNS servers\n3. Cache the results for 30 seconds\n\nMake sure to:\n1. Use your router's actual DNS IP address if you choose that option\n2. Consider using multiple upstream DNS servers for redundancy\n3. Verify that the DNS ports (UDP/TCP 53) are not blocked between your cluster and the upstream DNS servers\n\nAfter applying these changes, DNS resolution in your cluster should work correctly for both your local domains and external domains.\nhow can i check what is the dns server used by my wifi router?\nThere are several ways to check the DNS servers used by your router:\n\n1. Check your router's web interface:\n   - Connect to your router's admin interface (typically http://192.168.50.1 or similar)\n   - Look for DNS settings in the WAN, Internet, or Network settings section\n\n2. From your Ubuntu system, you can use these commands:\n\n```bash\n# Check the DHCP-provided DNS servers\nnmcli dev show | grep DNS\n\n# Or check resolved DNS configuration\nresolvectl status\n\n# You can also check your default gateway (usually your router)\nip route show default\n\n# Then query your router's DNS configuration\nnslookup google.com 192.168.50.1\n```\n\n3. Use dig to query your router directly:\n```bash\ndig @192.168.50.1 google.com\n```\n\n4. Check your router's current configuration:\n```bash\n# This might show DNS-related DHCP information\ncat /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases\n```\n\n5. You can also try traceroute to see where DNS queries are going:\n```bash\ntraceroute -p 53 8.8.8.8\n```\n\nThese commands should help you determine which DNS servers your router is using. Often, by default, routers use the DNS servers provided by your ISP.\nit does not fix the problem because the DNS name resolution in the cluster is overtaken by the new CoreOS deployment, and in order for the new CoreOS deployment to work correctly, it must first pull and image and a working DNS resolution is required.\n\nHow do i configure my CoreOS deployment so it's not used by the DNS resolution in the cluster?\nAh, I understand the circular dependency issue now. The problem is that your new CoreDNS deployment is interfering with the cluster's internal DNS before it can even fully deploy.\n\nTo prevent your new CoreDNS deployment from being used by the cluster, you need to:\n\n1. Make sure your CoreDNS service is not using the default DNS cluster IP range\n2. Use a different namespace for your external CoreDNS\n3. Configure the service to be explicitly external-only\n\nHere's how you can modify your Helm values:\n\n```yaml\nserviceType: \"LoadBalancer\"\nisClusterService: false\n\n# Add these settings to ensure separation from cluster DNS\nservice:\n  # Specify a non-cluster DNS IP if needed\n  clusterIP: \"\" # This ensures it doesn't get a cluster IP\n  externalTrafficPolicy: \"Local\"\n\n# Use a specific namespace\nnamespace: external-dns  # or any other namespace different from kube-system\n\n# Add labels/annotations to clearly mark this as external DNS\nlabels:\n  purpose: external-dns\n  \nannotations:\n  service.kubernetes.io/external-dns: \"true\"\n```\n\nThen install CoreDNS in a separate namespace:\n\n```bash\n# Create a dedicated namespace\nkubectl create namespace external-dns\n\n# Install CoreDNS with your values\nhelm install external-coredns coredns/coredns \\\n  --namespace external-dns \\\n  -f values.yaml\n```\n\nThis should prevent your new CoreDNS deployment from interfering with the cluster's internal DNS resolution while still allowing it to serve your local network once it's up and running.\n\nThe cluster will continue using its own CoreDNS instance (in kube-system namespace) for internal DNS resolution during the deployment of your external CoreDNS.\nwhat does the 'service.kubernetes.io/external-dns' annotation do?\nThe `service.kubernetes.io/external-dns: \"true\"` annotation is commonly used with the ExternalDNS controller/operator, which is a different project than CoreDNS. It's used to mark services that should have their DNS records automatically managed by ExternalDNS in external DNS providers (like Route53, CloudFlare, etc.).\n\nIn the context of your CoreDNS deployment, this annotation isn't actually necessary since you're not using ExternalDNS. I apologize for including it in my previous response - it's not relevant to your use case and can be removed.\n\nThe important parts for keeping your CoreDNS deployment separate from cluster DNS are:\n- Using a separate namespace\n- Setting `isClusterService: false`\n- Setting `clusterIP: \"\"` to prevent it from getting a cluster IP\n- Setting `externalTrafficPolicy: \"Local\"`\nit doesn't work, the service is not reachable. Now, DNS queries get 'communications error to 127.0.0.53#53: connection refused' and 'no server could be reached'.\nThe error suggests that systemd-resolved on the host (127.0.0.53) is not responding because the DNS traffic is being intercepted by your CoreDNS deployment before it can reach the host's DNS resolver.\n\nLet's debug this:\n\n1. First, check if your CoreDNS LoadBalancer service got an external IP:\n```bash\nkubectl get svc -n external-dns\n```\n\n2. Check if CoreDNS pods are running:\n```bash\nkubectl get pods -n external-dns\n```\n\n3. Check CoreDNS logs:\n```bash\nkubectl logs -n external-dns <coredns-pod-name>\n```\n\n4. Check if the service is actually listening on port 53:\n```bash\nnetstat -tulpn | grep :53\n```\n\n5. Try a direct DNS query to your CoreDNS service IP:\n```bash\ndig @<loadbalancer-ip> arcade.ici\n```\n\nSince you're using k3s, which uses klipper-lb for LoadBalancer services, there might be additional considerations. Try these modifications to your values:\n\n```yaml\nserviceType: \"LoadBalancer\"\nisClusterService: false\n\nservice:\n  clusterIP: \"\"\n  externalTrafficPolicy: \"Local\"\n  # Add these to ensure proper port binding\n  udp:\n    port: 53\n  tcp:\n    port: 53\n\nservers:\n  - zones:\n      - zone: .\n    port: 53\n    plugins:\n      - name: errors\n      - name: health\n      - name: ready\n      - name: file\n        parameters: /etc/coredns/ici.db ici\n      - name: forward\n        # Try explicit upstream DNS servers\n        parameters: . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n      - name: cache\n        parameters: 30\n```\n\nAlso, make sure:\n1. Port 53 is not already in use on your host\n2. Your host's firewall allows DNS traffic\n3. SELinux/AppArmor isn't blocking port binding\n\nCan you check these and provide the results?\ndidn't you write that Ubuntu uses systemd-resolved, that uses port 53? so I can't use port 53 for my CoreDNS service?\nYes, you're absolutely right! systemd-resolved is indeed listening on port 53 on the host, which is why your CoreDNS LoadBalancer service can't bind to that port.\n\nYou have two options:\n\n1. Use a different port for your CoreDNS service (like 5353) and configure your devices to use this non-standard DNS port:\n\n```yaml\nserviceType: \"LoadBalancer\"\nisClusterService: false\n\nservice:\n  clusterIP: \"\"\n  externalTrafficPolicy: \"Local\"\n  udp:\n    port: 5353\n  tcp:\n    port: 5353\n\nservers:\n  - zones:\n      - zone: .\n    port: 5353\n    plugins:\n      - name: errors\n      - name: health\n      - name: ready\n      - name: file\n        parameters: /etc/coredns/ici.db ici\n      - name: forward\n        parameters: . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n      - name: cache\n        parameters: 30\n```\n\n2. Or, disable systemd-resolved on the host to free up port 53:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved\nsudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved\n```\nThen configure a static DNS configuration in `/etc/resolv.conf`.\n\nThe first option (using a different port) is probably safer as it doesn't require modifying the host's DNS setup, but it requires configuring all clients to use the non-standard port. The second option lets you use the standard port 53 but requires more system configuration.\n\nWhich approach would you prefer to try?\ni prefer using another port for my CoreDNS service, but how can i configure my devices to use this non-standard DNS port?\nConfiguring devices to use a non-standard DNS port varies by operating system. Here are common approaches:\n\nLinux (Ubuntu, etc.):\n1. Edit `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`:\n```ini\n[Resolve]\nDNS=192.168.50.x#5353\n```\nThen restart systemd-resolved:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved\n```\n\nAndroid:\n1. For WiFi networks: Use a third-party DNS client app like \"DNS Changer\" as Android doesn't natively support custom DNS ports\n2. Or use a private DNS server with DNS-over-TLS (port 853)\n\niOS:\n1. iOS doesn't support custom DNS ports natively\n2. You would need to use a DNS client app from the App Store\n\nWindows:\n1. Windows doesn't support custom DNS ports natively in its network settings\n2. You would need to use a third-party DNS client\n\nRouter:\nThe best approach might be to configure your router to use your CoreDNS server:\n1. Keep your router using standard port 53 for client devices\n2. Configure your router's DNS settings to forward to your CoreDNS server on port 5353\n3. This way, all devices on your network get DNS naturally through DHCP without special configuration\n\nGiven these limitations, you might want to:\n1. Either configure just your router to use the non-standard port (easiest for network-wide solution)\n2. Or reconsider disabling systemd-resolved on the k3s host to use standard port 53 (more complex but more standard-compliant)\nok, I could deploy the CoreDNS service on my k3s cluster, but the service isn't working properly. I need to troubleshoot the issue. The pod is on CrashLoopBackOff status and the logs say:\nplugin/file: file \"/etc/coredns/ici.db\" has no SOA record for origin ici.\nAh, the error indicates that your zone file is missing the required SOA (Start of Authority) and NS (Name Server) records. These are mandatory records for a proper DNS zone configuration.\n\nHere's how to fix your zone file configuration:\n\n```yaml\nzoneFiles:\n  - filename: ici.db\n    domain: ici\n    contents: |\n      $ORIGIN ici.\n      @\t3600 IN\tSOA sns.dns.icann.org. noc.dns.icann.org. (\n                2024030901 ; serial\n                7200       ; refresh (2 hours)\n                3600       ; retry (1 hour)\n                1209600    ; expire (2 weeks)\n                3600       ; minimum (1 hour)\n                )\n\n      @\t3600 IN\tNS\tns1.ici.\n      ns1 IN A\t192.168.50.247   ; Use your cluster's IP here\n\n      arcade.ici.  IN    A        192.168.50.247\n      ai.ici.      IN    CNAME    arcade.ici.\n      ia.ici.      IN    CNAME    arcade.ici.\n      motel.ici.   IN    A        192.168.50.185\n      cloud.ici.   IN    CNAME    motel.ici.\n      nuage.ici.   IN    CNAME    motel.ici.\n```\n\nThis configuration:\n1. Adds the required SOA record with:\n   - Serial number (typically date format YYYYMMDDNN)\n   - Refresh, retry, expire, and minimum TTL values\n2. Adds an NS record pointing to a nameserver\n3. Adds an A record for the nameserver\n4. Keeps your existing records\n\nThe values in the SOA record can be adjusted according to your needs:\n- Serial: Update this when you change the zone file\n- Refresh: How often secondary DNS servers check for updates\n- Retry: How long to wait before retrying a failed zone transfer\n- Expire: How long secondary servers should keep serving the zone if primary is unreachable\n- Minimum: Default TTL for negative responses\n\nAfter updating the configuration, redeploy your CoreDNS instance and it should start properly.\ni still get the error \"dns: missing SOA record\"\nThe error persists because there might be an issue with the zone file format. Let's try a simpler and more explicit format, making sure all the necessary elements are present and properly formatted:\n\n```yaml\nzoneFiles:\n  - filename: ici.db\n    domain: ici\n    contents: |\n      $TTL 3600\n      ici.            IN    SOA   ns.ici. admin.ici. (\n                             2024030901  ; serial\n                             7200        ; refresh\n                             3600        ; retry\n                             1209600     ; expire\n                             3600 )      ; minimum\n\n      ici.            IN    NS    ns.ici.\n      ns.ici.         IN    A     192.168.50.247\n\n      arcade.ici.     IN    A     192.168.50.247\n      ai.ici.         IN    CNAME arcade.ici.\n      ia.ici.         IN    CNAME arcade.ici.\n      motel.ici.      IN    A     192.168.50.185\n      cloud.ici.      IN    CNAME motel.ici.\n      nuage.ici.      IN    CNAME motel.ici.\n```\n\nKey changes:\n1. Added explicit $TTL directive\n2. Made sure the zone name (ici.) is fully qualified (ends with a dot)\n3. Simplified the SOA record format\n4. Made all domain names fully qualified (ending with dots)\n5. Aligned the formatting for better readability\n\nAlso, make sure your CoreDNS configuration correctly references this zone:\n\n```yaml\nservers:\n  - zones:\n      - zone: ici.    # Note the trailing dot\n    port: 5353\n    plugins:\n      - name: errors\n      - name: health\n      - name: ready\n      - name: file\n        parameters: /etc/coredns/ici.db ici.    # Note the trailing dot\n      - name: forward\n        parameters: . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n      - name: cache\n        parameters: 30\n```\n\nThis should resolve the SOA record error. After applying these changes, check the pod logs again to see if there are any other errors.\ni still have the 'no SOA record' error. \nLet's try a different approach. The issue might be with how CoreDNS is interpreting the zone file. Let's modify both the zone configuration and how we reference it in the CoreDNS configuration:\n\n```yaml\nservers:\n  - zones:\n      - zone: ici   # Remove the trailing dot\n    port: 5353\n    plugins:\n      - name: errors\n      - name: health\n      - name: ready\n      - name: file\n        parameters: /etc/coredns/ici.db ici   # Remove the trailing dot\n      - name: forward\n        parameters: . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n      - name: cache\n        parameters: 30\n\nzoneFiles:\n  - filename: ici.db\n    domain: ici\n    contents: |\n      @ 3600 IN SOA ns.ici. hostmaster.ici. (\n          2024030901 ; serial\n          7200       ; refresh\n          3600       ; retry\n          1209600    ; expire\n          3600       ; minimum\n      )\n      @             IN NS   ns.ici.\n      ns            IN A    192.168.50.247\n      arcade        IN A    192.168.50.247\n      ai            IN CNAME arcade\n      ia            IN CNAME arcade\n      motel         IN A    192.168.50.185\n      cloud         IN CNAME motel\n      nuage         IN CNAME motel\n```\n\nKey changes:\n1. Removed trailing dots in the CoreDNS configuration\n2. Used @ symbol to represent the zone name in the SOA record\n3. Simplified the record names by removing the zone name and dots\n4. Made the format more compact\n\nAlso, you can verify the zone file syntax using the `named-checkzone` tool (you might need to install it first):\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install bind9utils\nnamed-checkzone ici /path/to/ici.db\n```\n\nIf this still doesn't work, could you share:\n1. The complete error message from the pod logs\n2. The output of `kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -o yaml <pod-name>` for the CoreDNS pod\n'named-checkzone' reports 'unknow RR type' errors on all declared names\nThe `named-checkzone` errors suggest there might be formatting issues with the zone file. Let's try a more standard format that's known to work with BIND tools (which `named-checkzone` uses):\n\n```yaml\nzoneFiles:\n  - filename: ici.db\n    domain: ici\n    contents: |\n      $ORIGIN ici.\n      $TTL 3600\n      @       IN      SOA     ns.ici. hostmaster.ici. (\n                              2024030901  ; Serial\n                              7200        ; Refresh\n                              3600        ; Retry\n                              1209600     ; Expire\n                              3600 )      ; Negative Cache TTL\n\n      @       IN      NS      ns.ici.\n      ns      IN      A       192.168.50.247\n\n      arcade  IN      A       192.168.50.247\n      ai      IN      CNAME   arcade.ici.\n      ia      IN      CNAME   arcade.ici.\n      motel   IN      A       192.168.50.185\n      cloud   IN      CNAME   motel.ici.\n      nuage   IN      CNAME   motel.ici.\n```\n\nAnd in your CoreDNS configuration:\n\n```yaml\nservers:\n  - zones:\n      - zone: ici.\n    port: 5353\n    plugins:\n      - name: errors\n      - name: health\n      - name: ready\n      - name: file\n        parameters: /etc/coredns/ici.db ici.\n      - name: forward\n        parameters: . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n      - name: cache\n        parameters: 30\n```\n\nKey points in this format:\n1. Added explicit `$ORIGIN` directive\n2. Added explicit `$TTL` directive\n3. All records are properly spaced with tabs or spaces\n4. CNAME targets are fully qualified (ending with .ici.)\n5. Used standard SOA record format\n\nTry running `named-checkzone` on this version. It should pass the syntax check.\nwhat is 'hostmaster.ici.' in the SOA record?\n`hostmaster.ici.` in the SOA record represents the email address of the person responsible for this DNS zone, but written in a DNS-compatible format. \n\nIn DNS records, the @ symbol (used in email addresses) is not allowed in this context, so it's replaced with a dot. So `hostmaster.ici.` actually represents `hostmaster@ici`.\n\nYou can replace this with any valid email address written in DNS format. For example:\n- `admin.ici.` (representing admin@ici)\n- `dns-admin.ici.` (representing dns-admin@ici)\n- `your.name.example.com.` (representing your.name@example.com)\n\nSo in your case, you could modify it to something more meaningful for your setup:\n```yaml\n@       IN      SOA     ns.ici. admin.ici. (\n                        2024030901  ; Serial\n                        7200        ; Refresh\n                        3600        ; Retry\n                        1209600     ; Expire\n                        3600 )      ; Negative Cache TTL\n```\n\nThis is just a contact information field and doesn't affect the actual operation of your DNS server. It's mainly used for administrative purposes when someone needs to contact the person responsible for the DNS zone.\nok, i had omitted the contact information field in my attempts. 'named-checkzone' reports no errors now.\nGreat! Now that the zone file format is correct (with proper SOA record including the contact information), CoreDNS should be able to start properly. Try to redeploy your CoreDNS with this corrected configuration.\n\nYou can then test it once it's running with:\n\n```bash\n# Check if the pod is running\nkubectl get pods -n <namespace>\n\n# Test DNS resolution using the LoadBalancer IP (assuming it's 192.168.50.x)\ndig @192.168.50.x -p 5353 arcade.ici\n\n# Test a CNAME record\ndig @192.168.50.x -p 5353 ai.ici\n\n# Test forwarding to external DNS\ndig @192.168.50.x -p 5353 google.com\n```\n\nThe dig commands should return proper responses without errors if everything is working correctly.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5865}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":116},"start":343,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5869}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":117},"start":1680,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5866}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":810},"start":3468,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5868}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":811},"start":5152,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5864}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":923},"start":5215,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5867}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":924},"start":6326,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5863}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1585},"start":6673,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5840}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1586},"start":8312,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5841}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1723},"start":8378,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5842}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1724},"start":9192,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5843}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":2008},"start":9354,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5844}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":2009},"start":10958,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5845}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":2401},"start":11076,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5846}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":2402},"start":12384,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5847}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":2719},"start":12506,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5848}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":2720},"start":13864,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5849}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3181},"start":14052,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5850}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3236},"start":14126,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5851}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3237},"start":15891,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5852}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3399},"start":15939,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5853}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3400},"start":17748,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5854}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3776},"start":17789,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5855}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3777},"start":19530,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5856}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":4451},"start":19602,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5857}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":4452},"start":21244,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5858}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":4844},"start":21289,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5859}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":4845},"start":22450,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5860}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":5827},"start":22555,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5861}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":5828},"start":23233,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5862}}}],"summary":"Understanding Ubuntu DNS Resolver Configuration","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
