Je veux me faire un petit serveur maison avec k3s pour expérimenter avec Kubernetes, un ordinateur avec processeur i5 de 8e génération, 16 Go de mémoire et un disque SSD de 1 To.

Je veux installer uCore (https://projectucore.io/) sur ce serveur car c'est une image du projet Universal Blue (https://universal-blue.org/) basée sur Fedora CoreOS. Je désire un OS Linux robuste avec mises à jour atomiques.

Toutefois, uCore n'inclut pas k3s. J'ai besoin de créer ma propre image personnalisée, et j'ai utilisé le template https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template pour cloner le référentiel et construire ma propre image.

Peux-tu m'expliquer les différentes étapes que je dois faire afin d'installer uCore avec k3s sur mon serveur?

## Agent

Je vais vous aider à créer une image personnalisée d'uCore avec k3s pour votre serveur. Voici les étapes à suivre:

## Comprendre votre projet

Vous avez créé un dépôt basé sur le template d'image Universal Blue, et vous souhaitez y ajouter k3s pour obtenir une installation de Kubernetes légère sur votre futur serveur uCore.

## Étapes détaillées pour installer uCore avec k3s

### 1. Préparer votre environnement de build

Vous avez déjà cloné le template d'image Universal Blue. Assurez-vous d'avoir les prérequis suivants sur votre machine de développement:
- Git
- Docker ou Podman
- Une connexion internet stable

### 2. Modifier le fichier build.sh pour installer k3s

Le fichier `build.sh` que vous avez partagé est l'endroit où ajouter les commandes d'installation pour k3s. Voici comment le modifier:

```ucore-k3s/build_files/build.sh#L1-30
#!/bin/bash

set -ouex pipefail

### Install packages

# Packages can be installed from any enabled yum repo on the image.
# RPMfusion repos are available by default in ublue main images
# List of rpmfusion packages can be found here:
# https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/mirrorlist?path=free/fedora/updates/39/x86_64/repoview/index.html&protocol=325https&redirect=1

# this installs a package from fedora repos
# dnf5 install -y tmux

# Use a COPR Example:
#
# dnf5 -y copr enable ublue-os/staging
# dnf5 -y install package
# Disable COPRs so they don't end up enabled on the final image:
# dnf5 -y copr disable ublue-os/staging

# Install k3s dependencies
dnf5 install -y container-selinux iptables

# Download k3s binary
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io -o /tmp/k3s-install.sh
chmod +x /tmp/k3s-install.sh

# Install k3s binary (without starting the service)
INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_START=true INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_ENABLE=true /tmp/k3s-install.sh

# Enable k3s service for future boots
systemctl enable k3s.service
```

### 3. Configurer systemd pour k3s

Vous devrez créer un fichier de service systemd pour k3s. Créez un fichier `k3s.service` dans le dossier `etc-systemd`:

**Use Tool: list_directory (toolu_01RzxTx5zpD8uAJpmWCJLkAL)**
```json

It is designed to be backwards compatible with SysV init scripts, and provides a number of features such as parallel startup of system services at boot time, on-demand activation of daemons, or dependency-based service control logic. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, systemd replaces Upstart as the default init system.\n \n Systemd introduces the concept of systemd units. These units are represented by unit configuration files located in one of the directories listed in Table 10.2, “Systemd Unit Files Locations”, and encapsulate information about system services, listening sockets, and other objects that are relevant to the init system. For a complete list of available systemd unit types, see Table 10.1, “Available systemd Unit Types”.\n Overriding the Default systemd Configuration Using system.conf \n The default configuration of systemd is defined during the compilation and it can be found in systemd configuration file at /etc/systemd/system.conf. Use this file if you want to deviate from those defaults and override selected default values for systemd units globally.\n \n For example, to override the default value of the timeout limit, which is set to 90 seconds, use the DefaultTimeoutStartSec parameter to input the required value in seconds.\n \n See also Example 10.21, “Changing the timeout limit”.\n 10.1.1. Main Features \n In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the systemd system and service manager provides the following main features:\n \n Socket-based activation — At boot time, systemd creates listening sockets for all system services that support this type of activation, and passes the sockets to these services as soon as they are started. This not only allows systemd to start services in parallel, but also makes it possible to restart a service without losing any message sent to it while it is unavailable: the corresponding socket remains accessible and all messages are queued.\n \n Systemd uses socket units for socket-based activation.\n \n Bus-based activation — System services that use D-Bus for inter-process communication can be started on-demand the first time a client application attempts to communicate with them. Systemd uses D-Bus service files for bus-based activation.\n \n Device-based activation — System services that support device-based activation can be started on-demand when a particular type of hardware is plugged in or becomes available. Systemd uses device units for device-based activation.\n \n Path-based activation — System services that support path-based activation can be started on-demand when a particular file or directory changes its state. Systemd uses path units for path-based activation.\n \n Mount and automount point management — Systemd monitors and manages mount and automount points. Systemd uses mount units for mount points and automount units for automount points.\n \n Aggressive parallelization "},{"title":"Understanding Systemd Units and Unit Files","url":"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files","text":"Introduction \n Increasingly, Linux distributions are adopting the systemd init system. This powerful suite of software can manage many aspects of your server, from services to mounted devices and system states. \n In systemd, a unit refers to any resource that the system knows how to operate on and manage. This is the primary object that the systemd tools know how to deal with. These resources are defined using configuration files called unit files. \n In this guide, we will introduce you to the different units that systemd can handle. We will also be covering some of the many directives that can be used in unit files in order to shape the way these resources are handled on your system. \n What do Systemd Units Give You? \n Units are the objects that systemd knows how to manage. These are basically a standardized representation of system resources that can be managed by the suite of daemons and manipulated by the provided utilities. \n Units can be said to be similar to services or jobs in other init systems. However, a unit has a much broader definition, as these can be used to abstract services, network resources, devices, filesystem mounts, and isolated resource pools. \n Ideas that in other init systems may be handled with one unified service definition can be broken out into component units according to their focus. This organizes by function and allows you to easily enable, disable, or extend functionality without modifying the core behavior of a unit. \n Some features that units are able implement easily are: \n \n socket-based activation: Sockets associated with a service are best broken out of the daemon itself in order to be handled separately. This provides a number of advantages, such as delaying the start of a service until the associated socket is first accessed. This also allows the system to create all sockets early in the boot process, making it possible to boot the associated services in parallel. \n bus-based activation: Units can also be activated on the bus interface provided by D-Bus. A unit can be started when an associated bus is published. \n path-based activation: A unit can be started based on activity on or the availability of certain filesystem paths. This utilizes inotify. \n device-based activation: Units can also be started at the first availability of associated hardware by leveraging udev events. \n implicit dependency mapping: Most of the dependency tree for units can be built by systemd itself. You can still add dependency and ordering information, but most of the heavy lifting is taken care of for you. \n instances and templates: Template unit files can be used to create multiple instances of the same general unit. This allows for slight variations or sibling units that all provide the same general function. \n easy security hardening: Units can implement some fairly good security features by adding simple directives. For example, you can specify no or read-only access to part of the filesystem, limit kernel capabilities, an"}]}

      "text": "Chapter 10. Managing Services with systemd 10.1. Introduction to systemd \n Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is designed to be backwards compatible with SysV init scripts, and provides a number of features such as parallel startup of system services at boot time, on-demand activation of daemons, or dependency-based service control logic. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, systemd replaces Upstart as the default init system.\n \n Systemd introduces the concept of systemd units. These units are represented by unit configuration files located in one of the directories listed in Table 10.2, “Systemd Unit Files Locations”, and encapsulate information about system services, listening sockets, and other objects that are relevant to the init system. For a complete list of available systemd unit types, see Table 10.1, “Available systemd Unit Types”.\n Overriding the Default systemd Configuration Using system.conf \n The default configuration of systemd is defined during the compilation and it can be found in systemd configuration file at /etc/systemd/system.conf. Use this file if you want to deviate from those defaults and override selected default values for systemd units globally.\n \n For example, to override the default value of the timeout limit, which is set to 90 seconds, use the DefaultTimeoutStartSec parameter to input the required value in seconds.\n \n See also Example 10.21, “Changing the timeout limit”.\n 10.1.1. Main Features \n In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the systemd system and service manager provides the following main features:\n \n Socket-based activation — At boot time, systemd creates listening sockets for all system services that support this type of activation, and passes the sockets to these services as soon as they are started. This not only allows systemd to start services in parallel, but also makes it possible to restart a service without losing any message sent to it while it is unavailable: the corresponding socket remains accessible and all messages are queued.\n \n Systemd uses socket units for socket-based activation.\n \n Bus-based activation — System services that use D-Bus for inter-process communication can be started on-demand the first time a client application attempts to communicate with them. Systemd uses D-Bus service files for bus-based activation.\n \n Device-based activation — System services that support device-based activation can be started on-demand when a particular type of hardware is plugged in or becomes available. Systemd uses device units for device-based activation.\n \n Path-based activation — System services that support path-based activation can be started on-demand when a particular file or directory changes its state. Systemd uses path units for path-based activation.\n \n Mount and automount point management — Systemd monitors and manages mount and automount points. Systemd uses mount units for mount points and automount units for automount points.\n \n Aggressive parallelization "

      "text": "Introduction \n Increasingly, Linux distributions are adopting the systemd init system. This powerful suite of software can manage many aspects of your server, from services to mounted devices and system states. \n In systemd, a unit refers to any resource that the system knows how to operate on and manage. This is the primary object that the systemd tools know how to deal with. These resources are defined using configuration files called unit files. \n In this guide, we will introduce you to the different units that systemd can handle. We will also be covering some of the many directives that can be used in unit files in order to shape the way these resources are handled on your system. \n What do Systemd Units Give You? \n Units are the objects that systemd knows how to manage. These are basically a standardized representation of system resources that can be managed by the suite of daemons and manipulated by the provided utilities. \n Units can be said to be similar to services or jobs in other init systems. However, a unit has a much broader definition, as these can be used to abstract services, network resources, devices, filesystem mounts, and isolated resource pools. \n Ideas that in other init systems may be handled with one unified service definition can be broken out into component units according to their focus. This organizes by function and allows you to easily enable, disable, or extend functionality without modifying the core behavior of a unit. \n Some features that units are able implement easily are: \n \n socket-based activation: Sockets associated with a service are best broken out of the daemon itself in order to be handled separately. This provides a number of advantages, such as delaying the start of a service until the associated socket is first accessed. This also allows the system to create all sockets early in the boot process, making it possible to boot the associated services in parallel. \n bus-based activation: Units can also be activated on the bus interface provided by D-Bus. A unit can be started when an associated bus is published. \n path-based activation: A unit can be started based on activity on or the availability of certain filesystem paths. This utilizes inotify. \n device-based activation: Units can also be started at the first availability of associated hardware by leveraging udev events. \n implicit dependency mapping: Most of the dependency tree for units can be built by systemd itself. You can still add dependency and ordering information, but most of the heavy lifting is taken care of for you. \n instances and templates: Template unit files can be used to create multiple instances of the same general unit. This allows for slight variations or sibling units that all provide the same general function. \n easy security hardening: Units can implement some fairly good security features by adding simple directives. For example, you can specify no or read-only access to part of the filesystem, limit kernel capabilities, an"

## Agent

Basé sur les informations obtenues, je vais créer un répertoire pour les services systemd. Premièrement, créons la structure de répertoire nécessaire:

### 3. Créer un répertoire pour les services systemd

Pour ajouter un service systemd à votre image, vous devez créer un répertoire `etc-systemd` dans le dossier `build_files`. Voici comment modifier le fichier `build.sh` pour créer ce répertoire et y copier le fichier service k3s:

```ucore-k3s/build_files/build.sh#L1-40
#!/bin/bash

set -ouex pipefail

### Install packages

# Packages can be installed from any enabled yum repo on the image.
# RPMfusion repos are available by default in ublue main images
# List of rpmfusion packages can be found here:
# https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/mirrorlist?path=free/fedora/updates/39/x86_64/repoview/index.html&protocol=325https&redirect=1

# this installs a package from fedora repos
# dnf5 install -y tmux

# Use a COPR Example:
#
# dnf5 -y copr enable ublue-os/staging
# dnf5 -y install package
# Disable COPRs so they don't end up enabled on the final image:
# dnf5 -y copr disable ublue-os/staging

# Install k3s dependencies
dnf5 install -y container-selinux iptables curl

# Download k3s binary
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io -o /tmp/k3s-install.sh
chmod +x /tmp/k3s-install.sh

# Install k3s binary (without starting the service)
INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_START=true INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_ENABLE=true /tmp/k3s-install.sh

# Create systemd service directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/

# Create k3s service file
cat > /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service << 'EOF'
[Unit]

# Enable k3s service for future boots
systemctl enable k3s.service
```

### 4. Personnaliser le Containerfile (Optionnel)

Vous n'avez pas besoin de modifier le Containerfile car il est déjà configuré pour utiliser le fichier `build.sh` que nous avons modifié.

### 5. Construire l'image

Pour construire votre image personnalisée, vous devez exécuter la commande suivante dans le répertoire racine de votre projet:

```bash
just build
```

Si vous souhaitez publier l'image sur GitHub Packages pour pouvoir l'utiliser sur votre serveur:

```bash
just push
```

### 6. Installer l'image sur votre serveur

Maintenant que vous avez construit votre image personnalisée avec k3s, vous pouvez l'installer sur votre serveur de plusieurs façons:

#### Méthode 1: Installation avec rebasing automatique

1. Installez d'abord Fedora CoreOS sur votre serveur en suivant les instructions officielles de Fedora CoreOS.
2. Ensuite, utilisez `rpm-ostree rebase` pour passer à votre image personnalisée:

```bash
sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/VOTRE_UTILISATEUR/ucore-k3s:stable
```

Remplacez `VOTRE_UTILISATEUR` par votre nom d'utilisateur GitHub.

#### Méthode 2: Installation via Butane/Ignition

Vous pouvez également créer un fichier de configuration Butane pour automatiser l'installation:

1. Créez un fichier `config.bu` avec ce contenu:

```yaml
variant: fcos
version: 1.4.0
storage:
  files:
    - path: /etc/zincati/config.d/90-disable-auto-updates.toml
      contents:
        inline: |
          [updates]
          enabled = false
systemd:
  units:
    - name: rpm-ostree-rebase.service
      enabled: true
      contents: |
        [Unit]
        Description=Rebase to ucore-k3s
        Wants=network-online.target
        After=network-online.target
        Before=zincati.service
        ConditionPathExists=!/var/lib/rpm-ostree-rebase.stamp

        [Service]
        Type=oneshot
        RemainAfterExit=yes
        ExecStart=/usr/bin/rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/VOTRE_UTILISATEUR/ucore-k3s:stable
        ExecStart=/bin/touch /var/lib/rpm-ostree-rebase.stamp
        ExecStart=/bin/systemctl --no-block reboot

        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

2. Convertissez-le en fichier Ignition avec l'outil Butane:

```bash
butane --pretty --strict config.bu > config.ign
```

3. Utilisez ce fichier `config.ign` lors de l'installation de Fedora CoreOS.

### 7. Configuration de k3s après le démarrage

Une fois votre serveur démarré avec votre image personnalisée, k3s devrait être installé et le service démarré automatiquement. Vous pouvez vérifier son état avec:

```bash
sudo systemctl status k3s
```

Pour interagir avec votre cluster Kubernetes, utilisez la commande `kubectl`:

```bash
sudo kubectl get nodes
```

Par défaut, k3s stocke son fichier de configuration à `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml`. Pour l'utiliser sans privilèges sudo:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kube
sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) ~/.kube/config
```

## Résumé des étapes

1. Modifier le fichier `build.sh` pour installer k3s et ses dépendances
2. Ajouter un fichier de service systemd pour k3s
3. Construire l'image avec `just build`
4. Publier l'image avec `just push` (si nécessaire)
5. Installer l'image sur votre serveur en utilisant la méthode qui vous convient
6. Configurer et utiliser k3s après le démarrage

Votre image personnalisée d'uCore avec k3s vous fournira un serveur Kubernetes léger et facile à gérer, avec tous les avantages des mises à jour atomiques de Fedora CoreOS.

Est-ce qu'il y a un aspect particulier sur lequel vous souhaiteriez plus de détails?
